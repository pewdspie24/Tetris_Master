## Prerequisites
This game runs off of a Python Library called PyGame, and the installation of PyGame is required.

**To install PyGame on a unix based system (does not include Mac):**

`python3 -m pip install pygame --user`

**To install PyGame on a Windows system:**

`py -m pip install pygame --user`

To install on a Mac or anywhere else, I suggest you Google it.

## Running the Game
Right well this is easy. 

Navigate to the folder where all the game information is stored in CMD or Terminal and enter the following command:

**On Windows:**

`Tetris.py`

**Unix:**

`python Tetris.py`

**If you have both python2 and python3 installed, run**

`python3 Tetris.py`

## Built With
* [PyGame](http://www.pygame.org/news) - The Python Library I used

* [JetBrain PyCharm CE](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/) - The IDE I used. Highly recommended as opposed to the regular shell.

* [Python 3](https://www.python.org/downloads/) - Duh.
